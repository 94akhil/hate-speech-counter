# Hate Speech Counter-Speech Generator

The popularity of social media has increased global communication and connectivity, but it has also given a
platform for hate speech. Therefore, it has become crucial to combat hate speech in order to sustain a
vibrant online community. Using counter-narratives with machine learning models like T5 can combat
online hate speech. T5 is versatile and produces high-quality text. It can automatically create new
counter-narratives when trained on a dataset of hate speech and counter speech. This reduces the time and
effort needed to construct counter speech manually. Python is a suitable programming language for creating
a system using T5 to generate counter-narratives against online hate speech.
