there are ways to overcome the problem, without treating it as a burden. for example, being more sensitive to people's needs.	i don't think it is true that people with mental disabilities cannot cope. they are just trying to live their lives as normal people, and this is what makes them different from others.	0.9200509771301854

the same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background.	down syndrome is a genetic disorder, and it's not related to any particular disability.	0.8866262910285945

who have you been spying on? not all homosexuals have multiple partners. some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. and that is valid for heterosexuals, too.	homosexuality is not a sexual preference. it is merely an expression of love and affection for someone who has been in relationships with them for some time.	0.881077845408226

since when has the bible said that it is okay to kill gays? are you saying you are ok with gays being executed? all people have right to life, regardless of their sexuality.	i don't think the bible says that all homosexuals should be killed. it is just an excuse to kill people of different sexual orientations.	0.9363460283409667
have you checked the records of all the gay offenders? or do you think that those stats are completely inaccurate? maybe you should check those before making such claims.	i don't think it is fair to say that all gays are criminal. they are just people who have been born in this country and have the right to live here.	0.9038323205593514

the idea that the holocaust was caused by the jews is simply wrong. the majority of jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. the persecution of jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression.	jews were not the real cause of a war, they were just victims.	0.9221352845757946
i would like to ask you a question: when hitler came to power in 1933, would you have believed him? would you now, after all that happened?	i don't think it is true that jews were the real cause of a war. they just wanted to live in peace and freedom, not to be oppressed by	0.889030566019411
